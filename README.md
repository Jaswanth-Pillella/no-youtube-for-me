# No Youtube for Me

## Description

No Youtube for Me is a browser extension made using javascript. It blocks youtube from loading in the browser. The idea behind this project is my youtube addiction, I wanted to reduce my time watching youtube but it was not possible. I tried many other exttensions with similar functionality but whenever I actually need youtube for work I had to disable the extension which I would never enable again.

This led to the creation of this extension, on the homepage of the extension there are two buttons namely Leetcode and My todo list, these buttons redirect to their websites accordingly. The technique I implemented for using youtube when we actually need it, is by creating a small toggle switch at the bottom of the homepage and whenever I on it we can see a new hidden button which is Piped. Piped is a privacy-friendly YouTube frontend alternative and we can use youtube from here. The next time you try to open youtube on your browser this button will be hidden.

## How to run?
